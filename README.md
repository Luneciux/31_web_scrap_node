# 31_web_scrap_node


Starting the development process. Since the front end will be simple, I'll begin with it. In fact, I'm still considering working solely with Express, but maybe React would be interesting, as it allows for more complex implementations in the future.

The idea is to build a web scraping application for the Amazon website. I'll receive an input, and based on the results page, I'll display the values on the screen. In the future, I might expand this idea to include some validations, or rank the values, like price, or even return to the user information like, "This product is out of the stock"

i'll still work on it, so it'll be private in some time
